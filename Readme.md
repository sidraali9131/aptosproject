# Escrow Smart Contract

## Vision

The **Escrow** smart contract provides a decentralized and trustless platform for securing transactions between buyers and sellers. By locking tokens in escrow, the contract ensures that both parties approve before funds are released, reducing the risk of fraud and creating trust in peer-to-peer transactions.

## Features

- **Create Escrow**:
  - Buyers can lock tokens in escrow, securing funds until both parties approve the transaction.
- **Release Escrow**:
  - Funds are released to the seller only when both the buyer and seller provide mutual approval, ensuring fair transaction completion.

## Future Scope

1. **Partial Approvals**:

   - Add support for partial approvals, allowing for staged payments during larger transactions.

2. **Dispute Resolution**:

   - Integrate a dispute resolution mechanism to handle cases where parties disagree on approval.

3. **Multi-Asset Support**:
   - Extend functionality to handle escrows involving multiple types of tokens and assets.

The **Escrow** smart contract enhances the security and trust of peer-to-peer transactions, creating a reliable method for buyers and sellers to exchange value without intermediaries.
